## The things in this project is done in the following order:
- 1st is to try and make a working noise
- 2nd is to try and do better grouping of characters
- 3rd one was a better static image
- then it was a process of improving what it was doing
- the last 1-3 lines of code are the heart of the project after all trial and erorr to finish the project.

## Motives Behind The Project:
- Started as something to generate good pixel art using noise.
- Slowly deviated into something which is more okay
- Then understood how impossible the idea is and decided to do a ugly version of the universe.
- Then the noie part started looking wierd and then just went from a noise project to a solar system project.
- Did a lot of trial and error on the colors but it ended up being bad
- Decided to finish the project, right then and there cos there was realistically nothing I know which I can do to make it better.
- Made it this far into the readme. Great!
- And ya that is the creation process of whatever u wanna call this ig.
- I personally call it a ugly bg generator.
- Sidenote: This does not work on itch io but I tried to make an online working version of it so ya pls try running the main program with the necessary modules installed.
- Redid the html part, so hopefull works in web.

OK then thanks for reading so far, hope u liked this joke of a project and thnx and goodbye!
